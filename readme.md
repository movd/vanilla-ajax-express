# Vanilla AJAX with Express Backend

Small example of AJAX with Vanilla JS. Using a simple Express Server.

The user inputs data in the frontend. This input will be sent to the backend using a POST request. The backend turns everything into CAPS and also generates a random integer and sends both back to the frontend where it will be inserted using DOM manipulation.

*Note: I put this together for myself in order to learn the basics of AJAX with Vanilla JavaScript.*
